# Contributing

- Open a PR with a clear description and links to issues.
- CI must pass (lint, tests, image build).
- Keep changes focused; avoid unrelated refactors.

## Local dev
- `python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- run with compose: `docker compose up -d --build`

## Commit style
- Use concise messages: feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:.
